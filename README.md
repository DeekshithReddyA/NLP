# NLP Projects

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks demonstrating different approaches to Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The focus is on text classification using Bag of Words and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The datasets and outputs used in these notebooks are derived from the Kaggle competition "Toxic Comment Classification Challenge."

## Notebooks

### 1. Bag of Words Model
- **Description**: This notebook demonstrates text classification using a Bag of Words (BoW) approach. It includes data preprocessing, feature extraction using the BoW technique, and model training using classical machine learning algorithms.
- **File**: `BagOfWords.ipynb`

### 2. RNN (LSTM) Model
- **Description**: This notebook focuses on text classification using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) or Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM). It covers data preprocessing, training, and evaluation. The dataset used is from the "Toxic Comment Classification Challenge" on Kaggle.
- **File**: `RNN.ipynb`
- **Dataset and Outputs**: The dataset and outputs in this notebook are sourced from and submitted to the Kaggle competition.

## Kaggle Competition

The dataset used in the RNN (LSTM) notebook is part of the Kaggle competition "Toxic Comment Classification Challenge." The goal of the competition is to build a multi-headed model that's capable of detecting different types of toxicity in online comments. You can find more details about the competition and access the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/overview).

## Installation
